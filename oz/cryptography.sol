    * public key is used to encrypt our plain text message.
    * to sign a meessage we used private key.
    * to verify a message we use public key
    
    1. using the private key + our plain text message = it outputs a signature which could look like base64
    

2. MerkleProof : Markle tree.

// 1. ECDSA : these  functions can be used to verify that a message was singed by the holder of the private keys of a given address.
